Curry won his first ever MVP , leading the Warriors to a championship that year, finally bringing one to the bay after a 40 year drought. </p4>

<p> After failing to become back to back champions in 2016, Curry and the Warriors regrouped, adding some key players to redempt themselves in 2017, winning their second title in three years.
